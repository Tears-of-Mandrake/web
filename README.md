# Tears of Mandrake

### 2025.06.01
Work has begun on the Tears of Mandrake 0.1.3 and 0.2.0 alpha update. Among the changes, better repository management. Version 0.2.0 should bring support for dnf5, earlier versions also support dnf5 but have problems with proper display on the screen of package installation operations, etc. 

A dedicated system update module is still being prepared.

### 2025.05.03
An updated release of the Tears of Mandrake application, version 0.1.1-3, has appeared in the Cooker, ROME (rolling release) and ROCK (Lx 6.0) channels, which fixes an issue with the incorrect activation of the extra repository in the repository selector sub-application.

### 2025.04.22
OpenMandiva Lx 6.0 has been released:
